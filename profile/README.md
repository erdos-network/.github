# Erdos Network 🌐✨

Welcome to the **Erdos Network**, a community inspired by the legendary mathematician **Paul Erdős** and his boundless spirit of collaboration. We’re building a space that connects researchers worldwide through shared authorship and the networks that grow from it.

Did you know?  
- Paul Erdős published with over **500 collaborators**.  
- The playful concept of an *Erdős number* measures how close someone is to Erdős through co-authorship.  
- Most researchers in math and computer science are within **six steps** of him.

## 🧙 Our Philosophy

Our goal is to map the global community of math and science researchers, tracing the threads of collaboration to reveal how ideas spread. By making these networks visible, we hope to foster a tighter community amongst researchers around the world and foster new connections stemming from the most unlikely places.

Just like Erdős himself, we want to connect people through ideas, one edge at a time.

## 🙋‍♀️ Who We Are

**Erdos Network** is currently growing out of **Ideas 2 Innovation at Amherst College**

We’re a collective of curious minds: students, researchers, and developers who see collaboration as the heart of innovation.

## ✨ Join the Network

This is just the beginning. Multiple projects will grow under the **Erdos Network** umbrella. Our first initiative, [Erdos Graph](https://github.com/erdos-network/erdos-graph), is designed to calculate Erdős Numbers faster and more accurately than ever before.  

Follow along, contribute, and help us map the world of ideas together. 🌍
